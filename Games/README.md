### Images
#### Header Capsule \*

	any retail box or marketing and make sure the logo is clearly legible.
- Usage:
	- It will appear at the top of your page in the store, in the 'recommended
	for you' section, in 'grid view' in customers libraries in the Steam client,
	in browse views on Big Picture mode, and for daily deals if applicable.
- Sizes:
	- 920px x 430px

#### Small Capsule \*
- Design:
	- These are small, so they should focus on making the logo clearly
	legible, even at the smallest size.
	- Small Capsule should contain readable logo, even at smallest size.
	- In most cases, this means your logo should nearly fill the small capsule.
- Usage:
	- These are used for all the lists throughout Steam.
	Search results, top-sellers, new releases, etc.
- Sizes:
	- 462px x 174px

	- A template will automatically be applied to your uploaded file, which
	will tint it blue and fade out the edges.
	- If you don't upload an image here, we'll automatically take a random
	screenshot and generate a background image from that.

	- This is the image that will be used in the background of your store page.

## Screenshot Assets

**\* Must provide at least 5 screenshots.**<br>

**Design:**<br>
Select screenshots that clearly show off the player perspective and gameplay in action.
Select screenshots that clearly communicate the genre of your game.
Showing HUD elements typically help communicate that to players pretty quickly.
Avoid menu screens. See requirements below.

**Formatting:**<br>
Should be high-res, widescreen format (16:9 aspect ratio) and at least 1920px x 1080px.

**Localizing:**<br>
To upload localized versions of a screenshot, drag and drop alternative versions
onto the designated area next to the screenshot below. Language name can be used
as a suffix to hint to the UI which language this screenshot should be in (For
example, foo_japanese.jpg)

**Mature Content:**<br>
If your game has mature content, you should upload and mark at least four
screenshots as being suitable for all ages. Suitable screenshots should not
contain gore, violence, or suggestive themes. These screenshots may be shown
outside of your store page, such as on the front page. If you do not have enough
screenshots provided and properly flagged, your game may not appear in these
places, even if it otherwise qualifies.
For non-mature products, checking the 'suitable for all ages' option also
works to specify a screenshot that Steam should prefer when choosing an image to
show in places on Steam outside your store product page.

**Requirements:**<br>
Screenshots should exclusively show the gameplay of your game. This means
avoiding using concept art, pre-rendered cinematic stills, or images showing
awards, marketing copy, written descriptions, and so on. Please show customers
what your game is actually like to play. Menu screens should only be included if
they are a unique component of your game.
